## 🔎 Key Insights
1. Most apps are free-to-use.
2. Game and Tools are the most common categories.
3. Reviews and Installs are strongly correlated.
4. Few apps reach 1M+ installs despite high ratings.
5. Paid apps don’t guarantee better ratings.

## ✅ Conclusion
The Play Store ecosystem is dominated by free apps, with only a small fraction achieving high popularity. Ratings show user satisfaction but don’t directly translate to installs.
